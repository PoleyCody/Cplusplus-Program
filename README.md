# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This program was made to analyze the provided text document for the user. In the menu the program asks the user to choose from one of the three chooses. The first choose is to produce a list of all items purchased in each day along with the number of times each item was purchased. The second choose is produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in each day. The third choose is produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in each day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased. The program would than run the choose and output to the user.

#What did you do particularly well?

I feel I did particularly well at producing the list of all items purchased along with the number of times each item was purchased.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could have enhanced the program by put the list in order this would have improved readability for the user. I could have also spent more time making my code more secure to handle more problems with input from the user. This would have made my program more usable for the user.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found writing Python on Visual Studio to be the most challenging, but I found that if I wrote it in PyCharm I could check my work and test it then when I was ready, I could copy and pasta it in. 

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skill I learned from this project was that its ok to use other IDEs if the program works in the end.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To ensure the program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable I am using the technique of naming meaning I named all values and methods of what they are used for. I also provided inline comments.
